                        Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned
                        at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the
                        titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own.
                        (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)

                        Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing
                        between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges
                        of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy
                        text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed
                        down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and
                        use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.)

                        Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your
                        choosing). Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color (of your
                        choosing). Make sure that the background color still allows the user to view the text in the
                        section and section title regions. Depending on the color you choose, you may want to change the
                        color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border on both the section and section
                        title region that is 1px thick. Warning: While not specifying borders and colors according to
                        the requirements does not hurt your grade so much, not doing so will make it much harder for
                        your classmates to peer grade the rest of your assignment, possibly resulting in a much lower
                        grade.
